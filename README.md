## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  1. Change "build" fields to your: id, product name, icon. (I do not recommend changing other fields.)
```

```bash
  2. Run "npm run build" to build react project.
```

````bash
  3. Then you can run "npm run app:dist" (to package in a distributable format (e.g. dmg, windows installer, deb package))
  or "npm run app:dir" (only generates the package directory without really packaging it.
  This is useful for testing purposes). - fragment from electron builder repo
```

```bash
  In dist folder you can find installer to your app. Enjoy!
